# Setting up Your Workspace for the Workshop

Try to find a spot which is **comfortable** and **relatively free** from **distractions and background noise**. Some people find a pair of headphones helps minimize distractions. 

**Ergonomics** are important! If you've ever tried to work on a laptop while sitting on a couch for multiple hours, it isn't ideal! We will take at least one short bio-break each session. 

A **second screen** is extremely helpful, especially for hands-on workshops where you'll be working through a software exercise. With a second screen, you can view the instructor's slides or demo on one screen, and open RStudio on the other.

# Viewing RStudio and Zoom Simultaneously

This workshop will be taught online with Zoom (the link will be sent you via email or a calendar invite). Below are some tips for viewing Zoom for a hands-on workshop.

## Dual Monitors (Best Option)

If you have an **external monitor** for your laptop / computer, you're all set. (Tip: turn on Zoom's *dual monitors* option, see below). Many TVs can be used as a second monitor depending on the video connections.

If you don't have a second monitor, a **tablet** may come in handy for viewing the slides / speaker. The Zoom App is available for Android and iOS.

Note however if you watch the slides on a tablet, you should **also** have Zoom running on your laptop so you can take the polls, click on links in the chat window, share your screen with the instructor, etc. In that scenario, you'll be logged into the Zoom meeting on two different devices, but only join the audio on one of the devices otherwise you may get a lot of echo!

## Tips for Using Zoom on a Single Screen {id="tips-single-screen"}

### Tip 1. Turn on 'Dual Monitors'

The Zoom client for Windows has a 'Dual Monitors' option that will open up screen shares in a **separate window**. You don't actually need two monitors. This option is really useful on a single monitor, because you can move and resize the screen share window anywhere you'd like (and even 'pin' it to stay on top, see below).

To turn on Dual Monitors, click the gear icon (Settings) in the Zoom client, then check 'Dual Monitors'.

### Tip 2. Place Windows Side-by-Side

You can arrange your windows so that you see both RStudio and Zoom side-by-side (see below for example). You can devote the entire width of the Zoom window to the screen share by going to 'View Options' and making sure side-by-side mode is turned **off**.

A keyboard shortcut on Windows to move windows to the left or right is *windows key* + *left/right arrows*. You can then choose which of the remaining windows to put in the other half of the screen. By default, Windows will divide the screen into equal halves, but if you resize the width right after you use the shortcut, it will remember the setting.

### Tip 3. Use a Utility to Keep the Zoom Window on Top

Surprisingly Zoom does not have an 'always on top' mode, but you can keep the Zoom client on top by using a 3rd party utility. Windows users can check out [DeskPins](https://efotinis.neocities.org/deskpins/index.html){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and Mac users can try [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

<div class="indented2" style="border:2px solid lightgray; padding:10px;">

**Example: Deskpins**

In conjunction with Zoom's Dual Monitor options, DeskPins let you 'pin' Zoom's window with the presenter's screen share on top, so you can watch the presenter's demo while also working in your GIS program. Pinned windows can still be resized and moved around, so it doesn't get in the way of what you're working on. 

![](images/deskpins_pinned-window_800x430.jpg){style="display:block; margin:1em auto; border:1px solid grey;"}

To 'pin' a window, right-click on the DeskPins icon in the system tray, and select 'Enter Pin Mode'. To 'unpin' a window, simply click the little 'x' button that appears when you hover over the pushpin icon.

### Tip 4. Use Sticky Notes

If you like to take notes during Zoom meetings, a Sticky Notes utility can help. Almost all sticky notes programs have an option to stay on top, so you don't have to worry about your notes disappearing. Windows has a built-in 'Sticky Notes' app, but an even better one is [Stickies](https://www.zhornsoftware.co.uk/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} from Zhorn Software.

## Sharing Your Screen

If needed, you can **share your RStudio window** with an instructor during an exercise to get help. Click the 'Share Screen' button on Zoom, and select your RStudio window. (Note: please don't share the entire screen to avoid accidentally sharing other windows!)
